Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

Since itemID is an attribute within the class, we don't need the global variable in the buy function. Since it's objected oriented, we would also change the disctionary into a list. Also, several changes needed to be made when doing object oriented propramming as compared to procedural programming.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think the program have the basic abilities to buy/sell a computer, check the inventory, and update the price/os.
I guess I am a bit confused about what methods should the computer class have, and I am not pretty sure if the program print out appropriate error messages.
Tutoring hours can be really helpful!
